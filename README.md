## Description

A web based implementation of the game of **Tic-tac-toe**, involving a On-line **Player** Vs. a **Computer** player. **Computer** player plays the game by randomly selecting empty (unselected) cells. 

To start game, on-line **Player** needs to select a symbol upon which **Computer** would auto-select a non-conflicting symbol for itself. **Player** goes first by clicking any cell and at completion of each click, check is performed to see if any of the 8 possible winning pattern was matched by the **Player** or **Computer**.  

#### Game over:

Once the game has a winner or there is a draw, a dialog would appear informing of result. You can restart game by clicking _Start new game_.
